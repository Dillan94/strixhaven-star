                <div class="byline">By Mina Lee, Investigative Reporter</div>
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>As students and faculty return from winter break to resume their studies, a troubling development
                        has emerged that has campus security questioning food safety protocols. Unidentified confections
                        bearing identical "secret admirer" messages have appeared across Strixhaven's campus, raising
                        serious concerns about magical food security in our academic community.</p>

                    <p>The investigation began when Greta Gorunn, a first-year <span
                            data-glossary="College of history and archaeology, famous for stubborn spirits.">Lorehold</span>
                        hopeful student and member of the <span
                            data-glossary="Strixhaven strength and athletics society that often helps with event security.">Iron-Lifters
                            Society</span>, discovered a suspicious muffin near
                        Strixhaven Stadium during her morning workout routine. The baked good came wrapped in a bag with
                        a handwritten note claiming to be from a "secret admirer."</p>

                    <p>"I was excited at first," Gorunn admitted during an exclusive interview. "Who doesn't want a
                        secret admirer? But then I found out other students got the exact same thing, word for word."
                    </p>

                    <p>Further investigation revealed multiple students across different colleges discovered identical
                        muffins and notes, all bearing the same unsophisticated handwriting. Analysis conducted by this
                        reporter confirms the messages were written by a single individual, ruling out any coordinated
                        effort by multiple students.</p>

                    <p>Perhaps most concerning is the casual attitude some students have taken toward consuming
                        unidentified magical items. Dream, a first year student who assisted in the investigation,
                        expressed alarm at this trend.</p>

                    <p>"Students should verify food is safe before eating anything found unattended - magical or
                        otherwise," Dream emphasized. "Some have found muffins on tables and benches around campus. Do
                        none of you have any caution? Have none of you been sick?"</p>

                    <p>When asked about their own approach to mysterious food discoveries, students showed varying
                        levels of caution. Some indicated they would discard suspicious items, while others admitted
                        they might investigate the source of anonymous gifts.</p>

                    <p>The incident has prompted calls for increased awareness about magical food safety. Students who
                        discover any suspicious items are urged to report them to faculty immediately rather than
                        attempting consumption.</p>

                    <p>As of press time, faculty members have not responded to requests for comment about enhanced
                        security measures or investigation protocols. This reporter will continue following this
                        developing story.</p>

                <div class="byline">By Mina Lee and Grayson Wildemer, Campus Reporters</div>
                <p>Sources close to the Strixhaven Star report whispers of an unprecedented student-organized alchemical
                    competition potentially planned for Strixhaven Stadium. While details remain scarce, early reports
                    suggest the ambitious event could involve multiple campus organizations and local eateries.</p>
                <p>"A cross-business cooperative competition of alchemical beverages and treats," is how one organizer
                    reportedly described the concept, emphasizing inclusivity across campus groups. The proposed event
                    would represent the first competition of such scale organized entirely by first-year students.</p>
                <p>Firejolt Caf√© owner Ellina Tanglewood has reportedly expressed enthusiasm for campus collaboration,
                    though official participation remains unconfirmed. Plans allegedly include relay races,
                    entertainment, and Iron-Lifters Society security.</p>
                <p style="font-style: italic;"><em>Students interested in participating or attending should contact the

                <p>Professor Verda Lang's advanced Otyughs examination showcased exceptional student performance this
                    week. Several students demonstrated mastery of complex Otyughs Lair Evidence and Guardian theory.

                <p>Students also shared winter break experiences, including heroic adventures involving spectral threats
                    to local communities. Such real-world application of academic theory exemplifies Strixhaven's
                    commitment to practical magical education.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, research into advanced necromantic theory continues under proper faculty supervision, with
